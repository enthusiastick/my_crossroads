As a real person, you may have a nine-to-five job or a course load at school, but when at a Terres Rising event, you become an actor and play the part of a fantasy character who interacts in the world of Terres Rising. You will build a unique persona of your own choosing. As you slip into your character's persona, you become part of the Terres Rising world, and the story unfolds around you, allowing you to affect the outcome of events that steer the course of the world for yourself and others. Terres Rising is intended for mature audiences, and not all storylines appeal to all people. As part of an interactive world, you may choose which storylines to follow and which to avoid.
